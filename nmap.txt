1. NMAP (Network Mapper)
-------------------------
made by : gordon lynon (pseudonym Fyodor Vaskovich)

other tools:
  • ncat (successor of netcat)
  • nping
  • ncrack (bruteforce crack)
  • zenmap

2. NOTES
---------
  • nmap scripting engine (NSE) is what controls and runs scripts in Nmap.
  • Forewalls,Routers,proxy servers and other security devices can influence nmap scan results

3. INSTALLATION
----------------
  apt install nmap

4. PORT STATES
--------------
open            : The application or service on this port is actively accepting connections (TCP, UDP, SCTP).✅🎯
closed          : No service is running on this port, but the system responded with a rejection (RST for TCP, ICMP for UDP) ❌
filtered        : No response received (neither SYN-ACK (open) nor RST (closed)), possibly due to a firewall, host being down, or packet filtering ❌
unfiltered      : Port is reachable, but its open/closed state could not be determined (e.g., in an ACK scan).✅ 🤔
open/filtered   : Port might be open or filtered, but Nmap couldn’t confirm because no response was received (common in UDP, NULL, FIN, and XMAS scans). ✅😐
closed/filtered : Port might be closed or filtered, but Nmap lacks enough information to determine the exact state (rarely used, but can occur in custom scan configurations) ❌

5. BASIC SCANNING
-------------------
    • (𝗻𝗼𝗿𝗺𝗮𝗹 𝗽𝗼𝗿𝘁 𝘀𝗰𝗮𝗻)(1000 common TCP IP ports)       
          nmap [ᴛᴀʀɢᴇᴛ]          

    • (normal port scan which gives 𝘃𝗲𝗿𝗯𝗼𝘀𝗲 output)
          nmap -v [ᴛᴀʀɢᴇᴛ]        

    • (normal port scan with 𝗺𝗼𝗿𝗲 𝘃𝗲𝗿𝗯𝗼𝘀𝗲 output)
          nmap -vv [ᴛᴀʀɢᴇᴛ]         

    • (𝘀𝗰𝗮𝗻𝘀 𝗺𝘂𝗹𝘁𝗶𝗽𝗹𝗲 𝘁𝗮𝗿𝗴𝗲𝘁𝘀)
          nmap [ᴛᴀʀɢᴇᴛ1] [ᴛᴀʀɢᴇᴛ2] [ᴛᴀʀɢᴇᴛ3] 

    • (𝘀𝘂𝗯𝗻𝗲𝘁 𝘀𝗰𝗮𝗻)
        nmap -sn [target]/[cidr] : eg:nmap 192.168.1.0/24

    • (𝘀𝗰𝗮𝗻 𝗮 𝗿𝗮𝗻𝗴𝗲 𝗼𝗳 𝗶𝗽 𝗮𝗱𝗱𝗿𝗲𝘀𝘀𝗲𝘀)
        nmap [target][ip range] : eg:nmap 192.168.1.4-10 (scans device with ip ending from 4 to 10)

    • (𝘀𝗰𝗮𝗻 𝗺𝘂𝗹𝘁𝗶𝗽𝗹𝗲 𝗶𝗽 𝗮𝗱𝗱𝗿𝗲𝘀𝘀𝗲𝘀 𝗳𝗿𝗼𝗺 𝗮 𝗳𝗶𝗹𝗲)
        nmap -iL [text file which contains list of ip addresses] : eg :- nmap -iL ip_lists.txt

    • (𝗲𝘅𝗰𝗹𝘂𝗱𝗲 𝘁𝗮𝗿𝗴𝗲𝘁𝘀 𝗳𝗿𝗼𝗺 𝗮 𝘀𝗰𝗮𝗻)
        nmap -sn [range] --exclude [ip address of target] : eg:- nmap -sn 192.168.1.0/24 --exclude 192.168.1.8

    • (𝗲𝘅𝗰𝗹𝘂𝗱𝗲 𝘁𝗮𝗿𝗴𝗲𝘁𝘀 𝗳𝗿𝗼𝗺 𝗮 𝘀𝗰𝗮𝗻 (𝗳𝗿𝗼𝗺 𝗳𝗶𝗹𝗲))
        nmap -sn[range] --excludefile [file containing target ips] : eg:- nmap -sn 192.168.1.0/24 --excludefile excludedIps.txt

    • (𝘀𝗲𝗹𝗲𝗰𝘁𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗮 𝗻𝗲𝘁𝘄𝗼𝗿𝗸 𝗶𝗻𝘁𝗲𝗿𝗳𝗮𝗰𝗲)
        nmap -e [interface] [target] : eg:- nmap -e wlan0 192.168.1.7

    • (𝘀𝗰𝗮𝗻 𝗶𝗽𝘃𝟲 𝘁𝗮𝗿𝗴𝗲𝘁𝘀)
          nmap -6 [ipv6 address] : eg:- nmap -6 fe80::f22f:74ff:fe9f:78f
