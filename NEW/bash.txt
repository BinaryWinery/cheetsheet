shell : If a program takes user input (commands), interprets them, and causes the OS to execute those commands, then that program qualifies as a shell
shell scripting : is series of shell codes (bash program can read and execute this script)

BASH (Bourne Again SHell) : successor of bourne shell (sh)
      commandline interface shell program used in linux and macos(unix based) 

other shells : c shell, korn shell , z shell, tcsh, dash ..etc)

1. HELLO WORLD
---------------
      #!/usr/bin/bash
      
      echo hello world

      result : hello world

2. SLEEP (delay before executing next command)
----------------------------------------------
      <string>
      #!/usr/bin/bash
      echo hello how are you
      sleep 2
      echo good morning

      result : hello world
               <-2 second delay->
               good morning

      <integer>
      #!/usr/bin/bash
      
      num1=20
      num2=87
      result=$((num1+num2))
      echo the sum of $num1 and $num2 is $result

      result : the sum of 20 and 87 is 107


3. VARIABLES
-------------
      #!/usr/bin/bash
      name="John"
      echo hello $name

      result : hello John

3. COMMENT
----------
      A. Single line comment
      -----------------------
            #!/usr/bin/bash
            #this is a single line commment

      B. Multiline Comment
      -----------------------
            : '
            this
              is
                a
                 multiline
                        comment
            '

4. OPERATORS - ARITHMETIC OPERATORS (calculate values)
-------------------------------------------------------
+   : Addition (adds 2 or more numbers)
-   : Substraction (substracts 2 or more numbers)
*   : Multiplication (Multiply 2 or more numbers)
/   : Division (Divide 2 or more number)

#!/usr/bin/bash

            num1=2
            num2=40
            
            echo the sum of $num1 and $num2 is $((num1+num2))             # addition
            echo the difference between $num2 and $num1 is $((num2-num1)) # substraction
            echo the product of $num1 and $num2 is $((num1*num2))         # multiplication
            echo the quitient of $num2 and $num1 is $((num2/num1))        # division
            echo the remainder of $num2 and $num1 is $((num2%num1))       # modulus
            echo the $num1 raised to $num2 is $((num1**num2))             # power

            result : 
                  the sum of 2 and 40 is 42
                  the difference between 40 and 2 is 38
                  the product of 2 and 40 is 80
                  the quitient of 40 and 2 is 20
                  the remainder of 40 and 2 is 0
                  the 2 raised to 40 is 1099511627776


5. USER INPUT
--------------
            #!/usr/bin/bash
            
            echo "Enter your name : "
            read name
            echo Hello $name

            result:
                  Enter your name : 
                  >> John  
                  Hello John
